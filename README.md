# OurInput Organization

## Description:

OurInput is a GitHub organization dedicated to reimagining the way we interact with digital text. We believe that current input methods, while highly functional for the majority of use cases, fall short when it comes to handling the nuanced and ever-evolving nature of human expression. Inspired by the freedom and flexibility of traditional pen and paper, we aim to build tools that empower users to create and integrate new characters and symbols seamlessly into their digital workflows.

## Motivation:

Modern input methods are powerful tools, but they often feel restrictive when faced with unique or emerging communication needs. Just as a standard screwdriver struggles with a tamper-proof screw, existing input systems can be ill-equipped to handle the "0.1%" of input situations that demand novel characters or symbols.

This frustration has been a driving force behind OurInput for at least two years. We see current input methods as digital typewriters, focused on providing pre-defined molds for text. While indexing and searching existing character molds is valuable, we question why users are not empowered to create and integrate new molds â€“ new characters and symbols beyond the existing character sets.

Our goal is not to create new fonts (which are merely representations of existing characters) but to enable the creation and integration of entirely new characters into the digital landscape. We believe users should not need external approval to use the characters they need for their communication.

Leveraging the power of modern AI, we've begun developing a foundational model for this new input paradigm. We are now in the process of refining and polishing this vision. We acknowledge that the simplicity of pen and paper may never be fully replicated digitally, but we choose to face the unknown future with anticipation and hope, while remaining mindful of the challenges ahead.
